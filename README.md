## Bank automation using python for Google sheets and Excel:

This is a work in progress, all of the code was in just one file, and currently working on re-building it.

This project is a tool I've been using privetly for some time, since it solved a lot of my issues with finance tracking, and now I took it as a chance to learn more about best practices, and create a program that can be used by others as well.
I use google sheets to have my finances tracked in a way that is customizable and easy to read, using google sheets / excel allows you to have your own functions and tables to extract the information you need.

### The main idea:
The idea is that you can download a bank statment (no matter how far in the future it is) and the program will sort it by categories and months, and then update the sheet for you.
This is what it looks like:

You can also add different categories that are relevant to you:
